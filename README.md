# Product Manager API

An MVC Rest API built using Node.js, Express.js & MongoDB. Secured with JWT, and documented using Swagger.

1. Format of the .env file:
  > PORT=<br>
  > DB_URL=<br>
  > SECRET_KEY=

2. Before cloning the repo, make sure you have a cluster ready on MongoDB Atlas. Paste the connection url in the __DB_URL__ val in the .env file.

3. Now clone the repo and install all the dependencies using: 
  > npm i <br>

  Then, start the server:
  > npm start

4. Once the server is up and running, you can test the API using Swagger UI by navigating to:
  >  http://localhost:3002/api-docs/
